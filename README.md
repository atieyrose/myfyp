Hardware Store Management System
This system focusing on attendance tracking for employee and store management.
It is a Web-Based system developed using Java, HTML, and CSS.
It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Use Java Server Page (JSP), Servlet, and MySQL.
For the attendance tracking, I use RFID Reader MFRC522 and ESP32. I am using Arduino IDE to send the data from ESP32 to API. Then, the data will be inserted into the Database MySQL.
